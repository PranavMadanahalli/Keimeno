# Keimeno

# Inspiration

I love reading books and listening to audiobooks! One Wednesday morning I was reading The Interpretation of Dreams by Siegmund Freud, but I had to go to school. I knew that I would not be able to physically read the book during the school day as my schedule was packed. I wanted to have a small audiobook segment of the book so I could listen to it on the go.

# What it does

Keimeno is an iPhone app that allows you to create an audiobook segment of anything you are currently reading in order to listen on the go. All you have to do is take pictures of a couple pages of a book or an article online and Keimeno creates a personalized audio book segment so you can listen to what you are currently reading on the go.

Instead of buying complete audio books on top of the actual book you have, Keimeno allows you to choose whether you want to read or listen for free!

# How I built it

I used Google’s Tesseract OCR API that scans images for text. Then I used the Text to Speech API from IBM’s Watson to read the text out loud.

# What is Next for Keimeno

I need to clean up the design and ship it. My friends are patiently waiting to use it!
